Spaceballs Pinball
==================
** MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU **

SKILLSHOT
=========
To Activate:  Skillshot is activated anytime a new ball begins

Summary:  The three lights in the launch lane will flash in sequence in various colors.
	Press the launch button on a specific color to get an award.
		- Red: Skillshot fail
		- Yellow: award points
		- Green: Award Bonus Multiplier

END OF BALL BONUS
=================
Summary: After each ball is complete, you will be awarded an end of ball bonus.  This
	bonus depends on several factors from the ball you just played.
		- Awarded Points for every Spinner hit during the ball
		- Awarded Points for every pop bumper hit during the ball
		- Bonus multiplied by a multiplier determined by gameplay, starting at 1X.

AIR LANE BONUS MULTIPLIER
=========================
Summary: This mode operates the top "A", "I", and "R" lanes above the pop bumpers.  The
	goal is to consistently light all three lanes.  Lighting all three lanes awards you
	+1x to your end of ball bonus.  Use the left and right flipper buttons to rotate the
	lit lanes.

DINER 2X SCORING
================
To Activate: Hit the center standup target to the right of Spaceball one 5 times to qualify
	the mode.  Once the "DINER" insert in front of the scoop is lit, hit the scoop to
	activate the 2X scoring for 25 seconds.

Summary: When this mode is active, the chestburster toy at the rear of the playfield will be
	dancing.  During this 25 second period, all playfield scores will be doubled.  It is
	useful to save this mode for when you have activated a multiball or a high jackpot mode.

AIRLOCK MULTIBALL
=================
To Activate:  Knock down all 5 drop targets to activate Airlock Multiball.   

Summary: This is an add-a-ball multiball that starts by giving you 1 additional ball

	Targets on the playfield will take on different colors depending on their reward:
		- Yellow targets will award a point value.
		- Blue targets will add a ball to your multiball.

	If you add all 4 additional balls to your multiball, you will get awarded an extra
	Schwartz gem when the mode is over.  Otherwise you will only be awarded one Schwartz gem.

WARP RAMP MULTIBALL
===================
To Activate: Shoot the warp ramp 4 times to progress through the warp speeds.

Summary: This is a 3 ball multiball that starts after you achieve plaid speed.

	The shots up the ramp award the following levels of warp speed:
		- Light Speed
		- Ridiculous Speed
		- Ludicrous Speed
		- Plaid

	Once the multiball is active, you can shoot the ramp again to increase the progression
	of the jackpot through the same speed levels.   If you raise the jackpot level to Ludicrous
	and score 5 Ludicrous Jackpots, you will be awarded an extra Schwartz gem when the mode
	is over.  Otherwise you will only be awarded one Schwartz gem.
	
	During warp ramp multiball, the orbit post at the top of the playfield will default to
	being up, unless a ball is being launched into the playfield.  It will drop temporarily
	for that.

SPACEBALL ONE MULTIBALL
=======================
To Activate: Lock 3 balls into the Spaceball One physical ball lock.

Summary: This is a 4 ball multiball that starts once you fill the Spaceball One lock with 3
	balls.

	During the first phase of the multiball, Princess Vespa's Mercedes will be pulled toward
	Spaceball One.  Your mission during multiball is to rescue her before the Spaceballs get
	her.  You have 30 seconds to send three balls through the Spaceball One ball lock.  You
	can reduce the number of balls your have to send through by hitting both of the flashing
	red targets on either side of Spaceball One.  You can only reduce the count by 2 this way,
	by jamming the radar.  If you are successful, you will get two schwartz gems, otherwise
	the typical one gem award.
