Spaceballs Pinball
==================
** MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU **

SKILLSHOT
=========
To Activate:  Skillshot is activated anytime a new ball begins

Summary:  The three lights in the launch lane will flash in sequence in various colors.
	Press the launch button on a specific color to get an award.
		- Red: Skillshot fail
		- Yellow: award points
		- Green: Award Bonus Multiplier

ORBIT POST LAUNCH INTERRUPT
===========================
To have the upper orbit post pop up on launch,  hold the left flipper button while
pressing the launch button.  The post will rise and drop the launched ball into the pops.

END OF BALL BONUS
=================
Summary: After each ball is complete, you will be awarded an end of ball bonus.  This
	bonus depends on several factors from the ball you just played.
		- Awarded Points for every Spinner hit during the ball
		- Awarded Points for every pop bumper hit during the ball
		- Bonus multiplied by a multiplier determined by gameplay, starting at 1X.

AIR LANE BONUS MULTIPLIER
=========================
Summary: This mode operates the top "A", "I", and "R" lanes above the pop bumpers.  The
	goal is to consistently light all three lanes.  Lighting all three lanes awards you
	+1x to your end of ball bonus.  Use the left and right flipper buttons to rotate the
	lit lanes.

DINER 2X SCORING
================
To Activate: Hit the center standup target to the right of Spaceball one 5 times to qualify
	the mode.  Once the "DINER" insert in front of the scoop is lit, hit the scoop to
	activate the 2X scoring for 25 seconds.

Summary: When this mode is active, the chestburster toy at the rear of the playfield will be
	dancing.  During this 25 second period, all playfield scores will be doubled.  It is
	useful to save this mode for when you have activated a multiball or a high jackpot mode.

AIRLOCK MULTIBALL
=================
To Activate:  Knock down all 5 drop targets to activate Airlock Multiball.   

Summary: This is an add-a-ball multiball that starts by giving you 1 additional ball and can
	max out at 6 balls.

	Targets on the playfield will take on different colors depending on their reward:
		- Yellow targets will award a point value.
		- Blue targets will add a ball to your multiball.
		- Purple targets will award a jackpot

	Whenever you hit an add-a-ball target or a jackpot target, another random shot will be
	chosen to replace it.

	If you add 4 more balls, you will get awarded an extra Schwartz gem when the mode
	is over.  Otherwise you will only be awarded one Schwartz gem.  Jackpots will also
	change to Ridiculous Jackpots if you add 4 more balls.

MERCHANDISING
=============
Hitting the Yogurt target 5 times will qualify you for a piece of Spaceballs merchandise.
Once qualified, enter the scoop to be awarded a piece of merchandise.  Each piece of
merchandise offers you a different bonus.   The items available will depend on which level
of the merchandising mode you have reached.  Doing merchandising once will blink the mode
insert and doing it three times will make the mode insert solid.

WARP RAMP MULTIBALL
===================
To Activate: Shoot the warp ramp 4 times to progress through the warp speeds.

Summary: This is a 3 ball multiball that starts after you achieve plaid speed.

	The shots up the ramp award the following levels of warp speed:
		- Light Speed
		- Ridiculous Speed
		- Ludicrous Speed
		- Plaid

	Once the multiball is active, you can shoot the ramp again to increase the progression
	of the jackpot through the same speed levels.   If you raise the jackpot level to Ludicrous
	and score 5 Ludicrous Jackpots, you will be awarded an extra Schwartz gem when the mode
	is over.  Otherwise you will only be awarded one Schwartz gem.
	
	During warp ramp multiball, the orbit post at the top of the playfield will default to
	being up, unless a ball is being launched into the playfield.  It will drop temporarily
	for that.

SAVE VESPA
==========
To Activate: The first two balls in any player's game that are locked in Spaceball One will
activate Save Vespa.

Summary: Save Vespa is a 2-ball multiball that is an add-a-ball as well.   When the multiball
	starts, Vespa will be drawn toward Spaceball One via the blue tractorbeam.  You have 60
	seconds to save Vespa from the Spaceballs.  Hit the lit shots to successfully save her.
	Look out for the radar jamming shot to buy yourself some more time!

SPACEBALL ONE MULTIBALL
=======================
To Activate: After Save Vespa has been done, Lock 3 balls into the Spaceball One ball lock.

Summary: This is a 4 ball multiball that starts once you fill the Spaceball One lock with 3
	balls.

	During the first phase of the multiball, Princess Vespa's Mercedes will be pulled toward
	Spaceball One.  Your mission during multiball is to rescue her before the Spaceballs get
	her.  You have 30 seconds to send three balls through the Spaceball One ball lock.  You
	can reduce the number of balls your have to send through by hitting both of the flashing
	red targets on either side of Spaceball One.  You can only reduce the count by 2 this way,
	by jamming the radar.  If you are successful, you will get two schwartz gems, otherwise
	the typical one gem award.
